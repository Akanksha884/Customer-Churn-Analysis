# 📌 Project Overview

This project develops an end-to-end Customer Churn Prediction System for a telecom company. It combines data analysis, SQL, machine learning, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard to identify customers who are likely to leave the service and provide actionable business insights.

---

# 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze customer behavior and churn patterns.
- Build machine learning models for churn prediction.
- Compare model performance.
- Perform SQL-based business analysis.
- Create an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

---

# 💡 Business Insights

- Month-to-month contracts show the highest churn.
- Customers with Fiber Optic internet have higher churn.
- Electronic Check users churn more frequently.
- High monthly charges are associated with higher churn.
- Long-tenure customers have lower churn.
- Customers without Tech Support are more likely to churn.
- Online Security reduces churn risk.
- Long-term contracts improve customer retention.
- Loyalty programs can help reduce churn.
- High-risk customer segments should receive targeted retention campaigns.
